## Breaking changes

The following changes are breaking. Note that although
we've tried to include all breaking changes with migration guides in the list you still may
experience undocumented changes. If you think that these changes worth including in this list,
let us know by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/issues/new/choose).

### createStyles breaking changes

[createStyles](https://mantine.dev/styles/create-styles/) function no longer receives `getRef`
as a third argument. Use `getStylesRef` exported from `@mantine/core` package instead:

```tsx
// in 5.x, will not work in 6.x
import { createStyles } from '@mantine/core';

createStyles((theme, params, getRef) => {
  child: { ref: getRef('child') },
  parent: { [`& .${getRef('child')}`]: { color: 'red' } },
});

// in 6.x use getStylesRef function
import { createStyles, getStylesRef } from '@mantine/core';

createStyles((theme, params) => {
  child: { ref: getStylesRef('child') },
  parent: { [`& .${getStylesRef('child')}`]: { color: 'red' } },
});
```

### @mantine/notifications breaking changes

[@mantine/notifications](https://mantine.dev/others/notifications/) package no longer exports
`NotificationsProvider` component. Instead you should add `Notifications` component to any
part of your application. This change allows to avoid unnecessary rerenders of child components
when notifications state change. Also `useNotifications` hook is no longer exported from the package.

```tsx
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';
import { Notifications } from '@mantine/notifications';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider withNormalizeCSS withGlobalStyles>
      <Notifications />
      <App />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```

### @mantine/rte package deprecation

`@mantine/rte` package is deprecated – it will no longer receive updates (last version will remain 5.x)
and it may no longer be compatible with `@mantine/core` and `@mantine/hooks` packages (6.x and later versions).
Migrate to [@mantine/tiptap](https://mantine.dev/others/tiptap/) as soon as possible.

### @mantine/dates breaking changes

All components from `@mantine/dates` package were rebuilt from scratch.
Note that the following list is not full as it is difficult to include all breaking changes
after a full package revamp – follow documentation of component that you use to find out about
all breaking changes.

- Styles API selectors of components were changed
- `DatePicker` component was renamed to `DatePickerInput`
- `Calendar` component was renamed to `DatePicker`
- `TimeInput` component was migrated to native `input[type="time"]` as it provides better UX in most browsers
- `TimeRangeInput` component was removed – it is no longer exported from the package
- `DateRangePicker` and `RangeCalendar` components were removed – you can now setup dates range picking in [DatePicker](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker/) and [DatePickerInput](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker-input/)
- `amountOfMonths` prop was renamed to `numberOfColumns` in all components
- `DatePickerInput` (previously `DatePicker`) component no longer supports `allowFreeInput` prop – use [DateInput](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-input/) component instead
- `DatePicker` (previously `Calendar`) component no longer supports `dayClassName` and `dayStyle` props – use `getDayProps` instead

### Theme object changes

You can no longer define `dateFormat` and `datesLocale` in [theme](https://mantine.dev/theming/theme-object/),
use components prop to specify format instead:

```tsx
// 5.x, will not work in 6.x
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider theme={{ dateFormat: 'MMMM DD YYYY', datesLocale: 'es' }}>
      <App />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}

// 6.x – use components props
import { DatePickerInput } from '@mantine/dates';

function Demo() {
  return <DatePickerInput valueFormat="MMMM D, YYYY" locale="es" />;
}
```

### Modal and Drawer breaking changes

[Modal](https://mantine.dev/core/modal/) and [Drawer](https://mantine.dev/core/drawer/) components
props were renamed:

- `withFocusReturn` → `returnFocus`
- `overflow` → `scrollAreaComponent` (scroll now is always handled inside modal/drawer)
- `overlayBlur` → `overlayProps.blur`
- `overlayColor` → `overlayProps.color`
- `overlayOpacity` → `overlayProps.opacity`
- `exitTransitionDuration` → `transitionProps.exitDuration`
- `transition` → `transitionProps.transition`
- `transitionDuration` → `transitionProps.transition`
- `transitionTimingFunction` → `transitionProps.timingFunction`

`Modal` styles API changes:

- `root` selector was removed – root element is no longer rendered
- `modal` selector was renamed to `content`

`Drawer` styles API changes:

- `root` selector was removed – root element is no longer rendered
- `drawer` selector was renamed to `content`

### Other breaking changes

- [Text](https://mantine.dev/core/text/) no longer supports `variant="link"`, use [Anchor](https://mantine.dev/core/anchor/) instead
- [Input](https://mantine.dev/core/input/) Styles API was changed – `disabled`, `invalid` and `withIcon` selectors are no longer available, they were migrated to `data-disabled`, `data-invalid` and `data-with-icon` attributes
- [PasswordInput](https://mantine.dev/core/password-input/) Styles API was changed – `invalid` and `withIcon` selectors are no longer available, use `data-invalid` and `data-with-icon` attributes with `innerInput` selector
- `invalid` prop was renamed to `error` in [Input](https://mantine.dev/core/input/) component
- [FileInput](https://mantine.dev/core/file-input/), [Select](https://mantine.dev/core/select/) and [MultiSelect](https://mantine.dev/core/multi-select/) components no longer support `clearButtonLabel` and `clearButtonTabIndex` props, use `clearButtonProps` instead to add any extra props to the clear button
- `@mantine/next` package no longer exports `NextLink` component
- [Checkbox.Group](https://mantine.dev/core/checkbox/), [Switch.Group](https://mantine.dev/core/switch/) and [Radio.Group](https://mantine.dev/core/radio/) components no longer include [Group](https://mantine.dev/core/group/) – `orientation`, `offset` and `spacing` props are no longer supported. This change gives you more freedom on how to organize inputs layout.
- [Chip.Group](https://mantine.dev/core/chip/) no longer includes `Group` – you need to manage layout on your side
- [List](https://mantine.dev/core/list/) component Styles API was changed, it no longer has `withIcon` selector, use `data-with-icon` attribute instead
- `withFocusReturn` prop was renamed to `returnFocus` in [Modal](https://mantine.dev/core/modal/) and [Drawer](https://mantine.dev/core/drawer/) components

## Variants and sizes on MantineProvider

You can now use [MantineProvider](https://mantine.dev/theming/mantine-provider/) to add variants to all Mantine components that support [Styles API](https://mantine.dev/styles/styles-api/)
and sizes to components that support `size` prop.

Variants:

## Updated @mantine/dates package

`@mantine/dates` package was rebuilt from scratch, it now includes new components to
pick [year](https://mantine.dev/dates/year-picker/), [month](https://mantine.dev/dates/month-picker/)
and [dates](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker/). All new pickers support `type` prop that can be:

- `default` – `Date | null` – user can pick one date
- `multiple` – `Date[]` – user can pick any number of dates
- `range` – `[Date | null, Date | null]` – user can pick a range of two dates

`type="default"` example with [DatePickerInput](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker-input/) component:

<Demo data={DatePickerInputDemos.usage} />

`type="multiple"` example with [MonthPickerInput](https://mantine.dev/dates/month-picker-input/) component:

<Demo data={MonthPickerInputDemos.multiple} />

`type="range"` example with [YearPickerInput](https://mantine.dev/dates/year-picker-input/) component:

<Demo data={YearPickerInputDemos.range} />

### [DateTimePicker component](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-time-picker/)

### [DatesProvider](https://mantine.dev/dates/dates-provider/)

`DatesProvider` component lets you set various settings that are shared across all
components exported from `@mantine/dates` package:

<Demo data={DatesProviderDemos.usage} />

## Overlay component improvements

[Overlay](https://mantine.dev/core/overlay/) component now supports the following new features:

- You can now render `children` inside `Overlay`
- When `center` prop is set overlay children will be centered vertically and horizontally
- New `fixed` prop controls `position`, when it is set `position: fixed`, when it is not set `position: absolute`

<Demo data={OverlayDemos.blur} />

## Modal and Drawer components improvements

### Modular components

[Modal](https://mantine.dev/core/modal/) and [Drawer](https://mantine.dev/core/drawer/) components
now expose modular components that can be used to build custom modals and drawers. This feature
allows you to have full control over the component rendering. Previous approach with single
`Modal`/`Drawer` component will still work the same way as before.

<Demo data={ModalDemos.composition} />

### Built in ScrollArea

[Modal](https://mantine.dev/core/modal/) and [Drawer](https://mantine.dev/core/drawer/) components
now use [ScrollArea](https://mantine.dev/core/scroll-area/) component to handle scroll:

<Demo data={ModalDemos.overflow} />

### Modal offset

[Modal](https://mantine.dev/core/modal/) component now supports `xOffset` and `yOffset` props
to control vertical and horizontal offsets of the modal content:

<Demo data={ModalDemos.offset} />

## Other changes

- `rightSection` of all inputs is now based on `size` prop by default (previously it was a static value)
- [Chip](https://mantine.dev/core/chip/) component now supports `filled`, `outline` and `light` variants
